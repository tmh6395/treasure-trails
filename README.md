# What is this?
This is a web app designed to make treasure trails in Runescape 3 easier to get through.


# Why did you make this?
I made this web app to help with clue scrolls, but also to get more experience in designing with React.js.  I did not want to just download third-party software like Alt-1 Toolkit, so I decided to make this.


# It looks like the wiki
That's because I gathered information from the official Runescape wiki and put the images in folders, and the information into json files.  The app reads the info based on what you're trying to find.  I also decided to use a palette with the same colors that the wiki has.  It looks good and is easy on the eyes.

## I hope that this helps you find clue solutions fast, as it helped me to do.

## Also, it's mobile responsive!
